# Functional Requirements 
Below is the detail of each criterion that we will utilize in our application.
## Scheduling meeting
By simply expressing a certain day in the scheduling method, students may set up a meeting with the recognized course instructor. Their availability hours will then be displayed, and students can choose a convenient time to schedule a meeting with the instructor to address any questions.
## Room Booking
All societies will be given access to the rooms that are available, and they will be allowed to reserve one room at a time while explaining why and for what reason they need it. The admin will then analyze their justification and, depending on the circumstance, either reserve a room for them or reject the request.
## Headlines
Users of this app may check what's trending on campus by using this feature. To inform the student body, they may either publish information about upcoming events or assess upcoming social events that will likely take place in the community. It’s like a social media feed.
## Reminder system
All students now find it extremely simple to get class reminders. Students need to set their timetable for the week which includes the location and time of their classes and they will get a notification few minutes before the class.
## Roll Number List
Students may now see their roll numbers with the seat number they are assigned for exam. Students may view their roll numbers, verify information about the center, and go directly there to merely present a paper without having to wait in line to find out where their examination center is when the administration uploads the seating plan to our program.
## Poll system
In order to choose amongst many possibilities, societies can now establish a poll system in this program and it will be shared with the students who can vote. You may either utilize it to elect a batch representative or, if you want to learn what the class wants, you can design a polling system and give the findings to the appropriate decision-makers.
## Resource sharing
There may occasionally be problems locating reliable course materials. Students may now contribute reputable content such as books, codes, lectures, and links using our program in order to share it with others so they can learn about it quickly.
## Non-Functional Requirements
Here are listed some non-functional requirements that must be fulfilled during the application development.
## Performance
Our application must be utilized simultaneously by many students since it must be for university students and administration. It must be capable of supporting 200 students at once without experiencing any performance deterioration. There should be no delays for any of the students or administration, hence our capabilities must be well-coded.
## Reusability
The majority of other projects can also use the system's functions because all of them can use the login and logout features. Our booking system algorithm may be utilized for any project that calls for any kind of booking, whether it's a library management system or registration for a vehicle, electronic device, or other appliance. The over traveling route concept is also applicable to any projects involving transportation services. Any council election, as well as elections for the government, may be conducted using our online election platform. To display the items that are available, any restaurant project can utilize our presenting menu tool.
## Usability
The application's user interface must be inviting and simple to use. It should not provide any difficulties to users. Additionally, the user interface will be consistent, ensuring that all of its components are uniform and providing users a sense of security, familiarity, and dependability.
## Security
To prevent unauthorized usage, the system will store sensitive data such as student login id passwords in a hash table. Your sensitive information will also be sufficiently protected so that no one else will be able to misuse it. Last but not least, all of a user's actions may be reported so that he is aware of any such behavior that is being carried out by that individual.
## Extensibility
We must allow for extensibility so that our current, declared functions won't still work in the event of a future update. We'll employ a few extensibility-enhancing providers, plugins, and modules to assist us do that. We shall bear in mind that each of our functions has to be independent so that past implementations won't be impacted by changes to or the addition of new functionality. The Dependency Inversion Principle, which enables extension, must be used for that.
## Sustainability
Any smartphone or tablet meeting the minimal hardware and software requirements can access this application without any issues.

# Important points
We want there a login screen in which we can either login as a student or as other user.
## Student 
Student login will take student to student interface, Student can see the daily feed or headlines, can access his/her calendar and exam and classes schedule or can plan his/her calendar, can create polls, can see the exam schedule and sitting plan uploaded by admin. He/she can see the lecture notes or e books uploaded by other students in a separate section of resources. Student can also reserve meeting hours with a faculty member based on the faculty member’s calendar.
Other users
## Student societies and clubs
They can add polls, reserve rooms and auditoriums (multiple) from the admin via the application. They can manage their schedule as well. Can post feeds, updates pictures publically which everyone can see.
## Faculty
They can upload resources under the resources section, can manage their schedule and upload their office hours which students can reserve and those reserved hours will be updated on the faculty member’s calendar.
## Admin
Admin can upload exam schedule (date sheet) and sitting plan, can overview (accept or reject booking requests by societies), can post publically about latest campus happenings and post updates.
